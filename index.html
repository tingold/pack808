      <h4>Our Base</h4>
        Cub Scout Pack 808 is chartered by <a href="http://fpcbelair.info/">First Presbyterian Church</a>, located at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/c5gKiGwmR1N2">224 N Main St. Bel Air, MD 21014</a> - across the street from Shoprite. We are a family friendly Pack; siblings, parents, and grandparents are welcome to attend meetings and events.
    </li>


<li>
  <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i>
  <h4>Pack Meetings</h4>
   These meetings are held on the third Wednesday of the month at 7pm at First Presbyterian.  All Dens attend the Pack meetings.  Pack meetings consist of an opening flag ceremony, advancement recognition, and group games. During nice weather, we try to hold as many meetings outside as possible.

  <i class="fa fa-dollar"></i>
  <h4>Pack Dues</h4> Dues are $95 per year.  These dues are due by the end of November and  cover patches, rank badges, beads, pins, belt loops, pack meetings food and activities and various administrative supplies. We <b>do not</b> require our families to sell popcorn as most local Packs do.
</li>

<li>
  <i class="fa fa-group"></i>
  <h4>Pack Structure</h4>
  The Pack has a committee consisting of the Cubmaster, treasurer, secretary, advancement chair, and leaders of each den. The committee handles administrative and support tasks that allow the Cubmaster, den leaders, and their assistants to focus on working directly with the Cub Scouts.

    <h4>Volunteering</h4>
    Everyone is welcome and encouraged to attend committee meetings, they are held the first and third Mondays of the month at Buontempo Brothers Pizza. It's a great way to get involved with the pack and help make you son's experience the best it can be

  <h4>Scout Handbooks</h4>
  A rank appropriate handbook will be essential for the boys to fulfill their full potential as Cub Scouts. For the boys to make rank advancements they will need to complete the requirements in their books and have each achievement signed off by their Den Leader. The Den Leader will then report advancement milestones to the Advancement Chair.  The achievement awards will be handed out at a following Pack Meeting.

  <h4>Scout Uniform</h4>
  Pack 808 encourages, but does not require a full head to toe Cub Scout uniform for Pack meetings. We understand that our boys (and parents) are all busy and sometimes a uniform shirt needs to be thrown on top of a soccer jersey and shorts.
A minimum Class A uniform would be comprised of a rank appropriate Cub Scout or Webelos shirt with all required patches (World Crest, Unit Numerals 808, and Baltimore Area Council patch), a rank appropriate neckerchief, and rank appropriate neckerchief glide.  Class "B" uniforms are available for sale.  Class "B" uniform are blue tshirts with Pack 808 logo.
